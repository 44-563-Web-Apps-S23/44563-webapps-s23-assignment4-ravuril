        <h6> THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK      _Sir James M. Barrie_ </h6>
        <pre>SIR HARRY. [_Rather anxious for corroboration._] Lord, how she winced
            when I said I was to give you those ropes of pearls.
            
            LADY SIMS. Did she? I didn't notice. I suppose so.
            
            SIR HARRY. [_Frowning._] Suppose? Surely I know enough about women to
            know that.
            
            LADY SIMS. Yes, oh yes.
            
            SIR HARRY. [_Odd that so confident a man should ask this._] Emmy, I know
            you well, don't I? I can read you like a book, eh?
            
            LADY SIMS. [_Nervously._] Yes, Harry.
            
            SIR HARRY. [_Jovially, but with an inquiring eye._] What a different
            existence yours is from that poor lonely wretch's.
            
            LADY SIMS. Yes, but she has a very contented face.
            
            SIR HARRY. [_With a stamp of his foot._] All put on. What?
            
            LADY SIMS. [_Timidly._] I didn't say anything.
            
            SIR HARRY. [_Snapping._] One would think you envied her.
            
            LADY SIMS. Envied? Oh, no--but I thought she looked so alive. It was
            while she was working the machine.
            
            SIR HARRY. Alive! That's no life. It is you that are alive. [_Curtly._]
            I'm busy, Emmy. [_He sits at his writing-table._
