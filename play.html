        <h6> THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK      _Sir James M. Barrie_ </h6>
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_Rather anxious for corroboration._]</p><p class="speech"> Lord, how she winced when I said I was to give you those ropes of pearls.</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS.</h6> <p class="speech">Did she? I didn't notice. I suppose so.</p>
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_Frowning._]</p><p class="speech">Suppose? Surely I know enough about women to know that.</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS. </h6><p class="speech">Yes, oh yes.</p>
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_Odd that so confident a man should ask this._]</p><p class="speech">Emmy, I know you well, don't I? I can read you like a book, eh?</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS. </h6><p class="direction">[_Nervously._]</p><p class="speech"> Yes, Harry.</p>
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_Jovially, but with an inquiring eye._]</p><p class="speech"> What a different existence yours is from that poor lonely wretch's.</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS. </h6><p class="speech">Yes, but she has a very contented face.</p>
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_With a stamp of his foot._]</p><p class="speech"> All put on. What?</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS. </h6><p class="direction">[_Timidly._]</p><p class="speech"> I didn't say anything.</p>            
        <h6 class="SIRHARRY">SIR HARRY. </h6><p class="direction">[_Snapping._]</p><p class="speech"> One would think you envied her.</p>
        <h6 class="LADYSIMS">LADY SIMS. </h6><p class="speech">Envied? Oh, no--but I thought she looked so alive. It was while she was working the machine.</p>
