        <h6> THE TWELVE-POUND LOOK      _Sir James M. Barrie_ </h6>
            <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_Rather anxious for corroboration._]</p><p> Lord, how she winced when I said I was to give you those ropes of pearls.</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS.</h6> <p>Did she? I didn't notice. I suppose so.</p>
        <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_Frowning._]</p><p>Suppose? Surely I know enough about women to know that.</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS. </h6><p>Yes, oh yes.</p>
        <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_Odd that so confident a man should ask this._]</p><p>Emmy, I know you well, don't I? I can read you like a book, eh?</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS. </h6><p>[_Nervously._]</p><p> Yes, Harry.</p>
        <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_Jovially, but with an inquiring eye._]</p><p> What a different existence yours is from that poor lonely wretch's.</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS. </h6><p>Yes, but she has a very contented face.</p>
        <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_With a stamp of his foot._]</p><p> All put on. What?</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS. </h6><p>[_Timidly._]</p><p> I didn't say anything.</p>            
        <h6>SIR HARRY. </h6><p>[_Snapping._]</p><p> One would think you envied her.</p>
        <h6>LADY SIMS. </h6><p>Envied? Oh, no--but I thought she looked so alive. It was while she was working the machine.</p>
